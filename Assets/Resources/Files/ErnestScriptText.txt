MISSPRISM
(Looks at LADYBRACKNELL, then sits in the CHAIR.)
I'm going to sit down for this.

(JACK picks up a HANDBAG of black leather)
(JACK enters CENTERSTAGE.)

JACK
(JACK Rushes over to MISSPRISM.)
Is this the handbag, Miss Prism? Examine it carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.

(MISSPRISM takes the HANDBAG)

MISSPRISM
(Calmly.)
It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here, on the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine.
I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.

JACK
(In a pathetic voice.)
Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.

MISSPRISM
(Amazed.)
You?

JACK
(JACK Embraces MISSPRISM)
Yes . . . mother!

MISSPRISM
(Recoiling in indignant astonishment.)
Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried

JACK
Unmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for men, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you.
(Tries to embrace MISSPRISM again.)

MISSPRISM
(Still more indignant.)
Mr. Worthing, there is some error.

(Pointing to LADYBRACKNELL.)
There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.

JACK
(Pauses)
Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?

LADYBRACKNELL
I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.

JACK
Algy's elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a brother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily, - how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?

(JACK Seizes hold of ALGERNON.)
Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.

ALGERNON
Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.

(ALGERNON Shakes hands with JACK.)
